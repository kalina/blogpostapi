# Notes
While this is not production ready by any means, I tried to take some steps to move it towards that point to try to allow for parts of this to change and evolve.  I used frameworks instead of base http and sql calls and began having a repeatable build and deployment process by having the software dependencies in a file and using a Dockerfile for deployment.
